Sporenkriege

Turns: 30 seconds to do stuff

Multiplayer?
    - LAN

Anticheat?
    - Checksum w/ server
    - Checksum w/o server

Types of Fungi:
    - Fly agaric (looks like mario mushrooms)
    - Puffballs; quicker spread
    - Cordyceps; recruit extra spores/fungi

Continuation: Endless play


Goals/Quests:
    - ...


Tendrils, Converges, and Hubs:
    Tendrils will automatically converge into nodes. These nodes help give an idea of progress: e.g. a competing fungus will take nodes at a time, and tendrils touching it will be disconnected.
    Hubs can be manually built. Hubs are stronger against infection than nodes, but take construction points or whatever (haven't decided) to place.
